# IzhikevichNeurons
Computation Neuroscience project for displaying Izhikevich Neurons.
The original Izhikevich neuronal model is described by a nonlinear mathematical model with a static reset map. Due to the fact that the reset is applied instantaneously, it is not easy to implement this model with analog circuits.
